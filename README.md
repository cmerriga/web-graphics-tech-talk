Presentation on the state of web graphics in 2011 for informal lunch series sporting JavaScript console.

Some practical, raw/ugly code that I created to do a presentation via a web page rather than PowerPoint. The JavaScript console is a REPL that processes raw JavaScript or a limited set of commands related to the presentation (next, prev, slide <.html>, load <.js>, ...). To get an idea of how it worked, enter "next" or "n" at the command prompt.

*There is currently a bug on IE that seems to limit input to 20 lines. I do not have an ETA for when I will make the fix.*
