Presentation for informal lunch series sporting JavaScript console.

Some practical, rawish code that I created to do a presentation via a web page rather than PowerPoint. The JavaScript console is a REPL that processes raw JavaScript or a limited set of commands related to the presentation (next, prev, slide <.html>, load <.txt>, ...). To get an idea of how it worked, enter "next" or "n" at the command prompt.
