automatically connects to the localhost on the current port
stays connected

client attempts to process messages but defers to server if needed
server processes messages
	server routes to other servers as needed
server considered home base -- typing at console assumed to be to server/client amalgam

sample execution:
connect chadd1 1999
	sets server's standard message forwarding to this
	throws out current connection and 

context is chadd1.console => ">"
	seeded with mru children from server
user chooses chadd context => "chadd>"
user chooses techtalk context =>"chadd.techtalk>"
user chooses canvas context => "chadd.techtalk.canvas>"
